# Rock-paper-scissors-game-
It is a game which like we play rock paper scissor 
Sure! Here’s a simple Python program for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game:

import random

def get_user_choice():
    user_input = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
    while user_input not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
        user_input = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
    return user_input

def get_computer_choice():
    return random.choice(['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'])

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \
         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "You lose!"

def play_game():
    print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    print(f"You chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")
    result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()

You can run this program in any Python environment. Here’s a quick breakdown of what each function does:

	1.	get_user_choice() - Prompts the user to enter their choice and ensures it’s valid.
	2.	get_computer_choice() - Randomly selects a choice for the computer.
	3.	determine_winner() - Compares the choices and determines the winner based on the rules.
	4.	play_game() - Coordinates the game flow by calling the other functions and displaying the results.

This program will let you play a single round of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
